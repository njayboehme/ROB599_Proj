# VLM-Guided Path Planning

This project implements an end-to-end ROS 2 system to leverage the semantic reasoning ability of VLMs to guide a robot's path planning in a 2D maze.

## How to run this project locally:
1. Create a new ROS 2 workspace and an `src` directory in its root.
2. Navigate to the `src` directy with `cd src` and clone this repository.
3. Create a new Python3 virtual environment (`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`) and source it (`source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate`).
